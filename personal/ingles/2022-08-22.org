* Use
1) *Would like* means *want*, but it is more polite. You can use it in sentences and questions.
   - /I’d like a biscuit/.
   - /Would you like some tea?/
2) You can also use it to talk about your dreams and ambitions.
   - /I’d like to go to Japan/.
   - /I wouldn’t like to live here!/
   - You can also use *I’d love* and *I’d hate* to talk about dreams.
     - /I’d hate to live in the countryside/.
     - /I’d love to work with Simon/.
* Form
1) Would like is the same for all persons.

   - _You would like_ some tea.
   - _He / she / James would like_ some tea.
   - _We would like_ some tea.
   - _They / our clients would like_ some tea.
2) To make questions, invert *the subject* and *would*.
   - _Would you / James / your clients like_ some tea?
3) Use *wouldn’t* to make the negative form.
   - _I wouldn’t like_ to work there.
4) *Would like* can be followed by *a noun* or *to + verb*.

   - But NOT in negative sentences:
     - I’dn’t like to work in a factory. => I wouldn’t like to work in a factory.
   - And NOT in short answers:
     - Would you like to have a horse?
       - Yes, I’d. => Yes, I would.
6) Be careful not to confuse *would like* and *like*.
   - Use *like* to talk about things you like all the time.
     - I like chocolate cake. It’s my favourite food.
   - Use *would like* to talk about things you want now, or at some time in the future.
